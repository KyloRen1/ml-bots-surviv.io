# Intro
We present our **machine learning bot** (ml-bot is in alpha testing), which can play the [surviv.io](https://surviv.io/) game.

This bot tries to solve only **the locomotion problem** by training on human gameplay. To train this agent, we have used [100 youtube-videos](for_annotators/video_data) containing 1.2 million frames (equivalent to ~12 hours of gameplay recordings).

#### Main features:
- our bot can get closer to the boxes with loot
- our bot knows how to avoid red zone
- our bot is trying to get out of the red zone (if the zone has covered it)
- our bot begins to move chaotically, when enemies shoot at him
- our bot likes to build a route through the bushes

# Motivation
The goal is to develop a bot that is interesting to watch. The behavior of the bot should not differ from the behavior of a person in similar situations. Our research will help raise the level of AI in games, make games more interesting, and bots in them more similar to the actions of a real person.

We assume that if people are interested in watching other gamers (professional or not) through [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), then they will be interested in watching our agent as well.
