# Intro
We present our **machine learning bot** (ml-bot is in alpha testing), which plays the [game](https://surviv.io/) itself.

This bot tries to solve only **the locomotion problem** by training on human gameplay. To train this agent, we used [100 youtube-videos](for_annotators/video_data) containing 1.2 million frames (equivalent to ~12 hours of gameplay recordings).

#### Main features:
- our bot can get closer to the boxes with loot
- our bot knows how to avoid red zone
- our bot is trying to get out of the red zone (if the zone has covered it)
- our bot begins to move chaotically, when enemies shoot at him
- our bot likes to build a route through the bushes

# Motivation
The goal is to develop a bot that was interesting to watch. The behavior of the bot should not differ from the behavior of a person in similar situations. Our research will help raise the level of AI in games, make games more interesting, and bots in them more similar to the actions of a real person.

We assume that if people are interested in watching other gamers (professional or not) through [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), then they will be interested in watching our agent as well.

# Installation guide for Windows

<details>
  <summary>see guide for Windows</summary>
  
  ### Before the first launch
  **1.** Check that you have Anaconda3 with python3

  **2.** Check that you have google chrome browser (our agent supports only chrome)

  ### For the first launch
  **0.** Earlier you do 1-2 steps from paragraph *Before the first launch*

  **1.** Clone repo by *Anaconda Prompt* or dowland zip-file repo and unzip it
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Laggg/ml-bots-surviv.io.git
  ```
  **2.** Dowland neural net weights from [this link](https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1l3exfxwT4ZVk1R6V2sxZimTafx1EkNtO&export=download) and put it into *./supporting_files/* folder

  **3.** Dowland driver for your OS and for your chrome version (don't forget to check your google chrome version!) from [link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), unzip it and put into *./supporting_files/* folder

  > after 3rd step you can check *./supporting_files/* folder:

  **5.** Create a virtual environment for this project
  ```
  python â€“m venv surviv_env
  ```
  **6.** Activate created virtual environment
  ```
  cd surviv_env/scripts && activate && cd ../../
  ```
  **7.** Install all required libraries
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  **8.** Launch the agent into the game!
  ```
  python play.py
  ```
  **9.** After all you can deactivate virtual env and close Anaconda prompt window
  
  ### For the second+ launch
  **0.** Earlier you do 1-9 steps from paragraph *For the first launch*

  **1.** Open Anaconda prompt inside repo-folder

  **2.** ```cd surviv_env/scripts && activate && cd ../../```

  **3.** ```python play.py```

  **4.** After all you can close deactivate virtual env and close Anaconda prompt window
